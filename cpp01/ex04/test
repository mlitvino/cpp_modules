The cosmos (/ˈkɒzmɒs/, US also /-moʊs, -məs/;[1]
Ancient Greek: κόσμος, romanized: kósmos) is an alternative name for the universe or its nature or order.
Usage of the word cosmos implies viewing the universe as a complex and orderly system or entity.[2]

The cosmos is studied in cosmology – a broad discipline covering scientific,
religious or philosophical aspects of the cosmos and its nature.
Religious and philosophical approaches may include the cosmos among spiritual entities or
other matters deemed to exist outside the physical universe.
